    <p>
        This meal is one so good that competitors have been trying to steal this recipe for years! Lucky for you, I'm bored and giving it away </br>
        this <i>secret</i> information. The krabby patty is the most renown meal from the show Spongebob Squarepants. It is served at the Krusty Krab and </br>
        could possibly the best burger to exist. Yes, even better than the Hit Me With Your Best Shallot Burger. </br>

    <strong>Ingredients</strong>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3lb. of Ground Beef</li>
        <li>3 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tsp. of Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp. of Sea Salt</li>
        <li>4 Slices of Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>4 Sesame Seed Buns, Sliced in Half</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>1 Jar of Dill Pickle Slices</li>
        <li>1 Red Onion, Sliced</li>
        <li>1 Tomato, Sliced</li>
        <li>4 Leaves of Butter Lettuce</li>
        <li>1/2 c. of Mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Steps</strong>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>Make the Burger Patties.</em>
            </br>
            Heat a grill pan or saute pan at medium heat. While it heats combine the ground beef, salt, pepper, and 2 tsp. old bay seasoning. Now 
            form four equally sized patties (roughly 1/3lb each). Cook on each side for 4-5 minutes.
        </li>
        </br>
        <li>
            <em>Cheese the Burgers.</em>
            </br>
            Use a star shape cookie cutter to cut each slice of cheese into a star. Place the star shaped cheese on the patties
            when there is about 30 seconds left of cooking. This gets the cheese to melt.
        </li>
        </br>
        <li>
            <em>Create King Neptune's Poseidon Powder Aioli.</em>
            </br>
            Stir the mayo and remaining old bay until thoroughly combined.
        </li>
        </br>
        <li>
            <em>Assemble the Sandwhich.</em>
            </br>
            Spread the aioli on the bottom of each bun. Then top it with a burger patty, ketchup, mustard, pickles, onions,
            lettuce, and tomato. Then put the top bun on and serve.
        </li>
    </br>
    </ol>
