## Description
This website is a part of the Odin Project, in the Foundations part. This website will feature four webpages, one for each recipe. Each website will have a brief description of the meal, an image of the finished result, and the recipe. The recipes come from TV Shows that I am a fan of. I wanted to choose something fun and recipe related, so that is why I chose these recipes. 

See the list of recipes below.
<li>Krabby Patties</li>
<li>Hit Me With Your Best Shallot Burger</li>
<li>Cheesy Blasters</li>

## Tech Stack

<li>VS-Code as the IDE.</li>
